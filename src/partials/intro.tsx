        I love to both build and break things. I am motivated by challenging
        projects with self-guided research and dynamic problem solving. My
        true passion is crafting creative front end designs with unique
        takes on color, typography and motion.

      During my career I have built products ranging from school curriculum and management
        websites to complex enterprise apps with focus on delivering fast,
        elegant code along with delightful user interfaces.
